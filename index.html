    <h3>1. Difference between HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><em><b>Binary protocols</b></em> – Binary protocols consume less bandwidth, are more efficiently parsed and are less error-prone than the textual protocols used by HTTP/1.1. Additionally, they can better handle elements such as whitespace, capitalization and line endings.</li>
            <br>
            <li><em><b>Multiplexing</b></em> – HTTP/2 is multiplexed, i.e., it can initiate multiple requests in parallel over a single TCP connection. As a result, web pages containing several elements are delivered over one TCP connection. These capabilities solve the head-of-line blocking problem in HTTP/1.1, in which a packet at the front of the line blocks others from being transmitted.</li>
            <br>
            <li><em><b>Header compression</b></em> – HTTP/2 uses header compression to reduce the overhead caused by TCP’s slow   start mechanism.</li>        
            <br>
            <li><em><b>Server push</b></em> – HTTP/2 servers push likely-to-be-used resources into a browser’s cache, even before they’re requested. This allows browsers to display content without additional request cycles.</li>
            <br>
            <li><em><b>Increased security</b></em> – Web browsers only support HTTP/2 via encrypted connections, increasing user and application security.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>2. Object in javaScript and its internal representataion </h3>
        <p style="text-indent :5em;">
            Every thing in javaScriptis an object,exept Primitive datas. objects are nothing but Key:value pairs. where key can be used and an index to retrive the value. 
            <p style="text-indent :5em;">
            In other words A JavaScript object is a collection of named values.The named values, in JavaScript objects, are called properties.
        </p style="text-indent :5em;">
        <p>There are different ways to create new objects:
            <ol>
                <li>Create a single object, using an object literal. <br> Ex: const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};</li>
                <li>Create a single object, with the keyword new. <br> Ex: const person = new Object(); </li>
                <li>Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type. <br> Ex: const myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue"); </li>
                <li>Create an object using Object.create() <br> Ex: const me = Object.create(person); .</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        </p>
        <h4>Internal Representation of object</h4>
        <p>To understand this rather abstract definition, let us look at an example of a JavaScript Object :
<div>
    <p>
        let school = { <br>
            name : “Vivekananda School”,<br>
            location : “Delhi”,<br>
            established : “1971” <br>
            }   <br>
    </p>
</div>
           
            In the above example “name”, “location”, “established” are all “keys” and “Vivekananda School”, “Delhi” and 1971 are values of these keys respectively.
            
            Each of these keys is referred to as properties of the object&#128522;</p>
